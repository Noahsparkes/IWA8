Objects

This is an exerscise that tests our knowledge of javascript.
The goal is to create two objects with relevant keys and values within those keys.
We do this by first initializing all the relevant info first i.e. Name, number etc.
After that we create the object naming the object the same name as the person whos info is being filled in.
The keys in this case are basic peices iof information about the person.

features 

- Object Declaration: The code declares two JavaScript objects, leo and sarah, using the curly braces {} notation. 
These objects represent individuals and store their relevant information.

- Object Properties: Each object has properties that store specific information. 
For example, leo has properties like fullname, balance, accessId, age, and leoAddress. 
Similarly, sarah has properties like fullname, balance, accessId, age, and sarahAddress.

- Console Output: The console.log() function is used to print the objects leo and sarah to the console. 
This allows you to inspect the objects and their properties/values in the console output when the code is executed.
